# Gene expression variability in human and chimpanzee populations

## Abstract
This work is an attempt to reproduce certain results from the article ["Gene expression variability in human and chimpanzee populations share common determinants"](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59929) (Benjamin Jung et al., 2020)[^1] and to expand the list of genes with varying expression levels between humans and chimpanzees.







## Materials and methods
In the subsequent analysis, we will retain only orthologous genes that uniquely correspond between human and chimpanzee[^2].
